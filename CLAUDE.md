# TerraTone — notes for Claude Code

This app runs on **Homeroom**. If you're Claude Code
editing this repo, read the platform conventions before making
changes:

**Platform conventions (authoritative, always current):**
https://app.onhomeroom.com/claude.md

Fetch that URL at the start of each session — it's the single source
of truth for platform-wide behavior (auth model, `USERNODE_ENV`,
public/private tables, "don't `git push`", etc.). The hosted copy is
updated in place when platform rules change, so fetching it gives you
today's rules, not a stale snapshot.

When running inside Homeroom's dev-chat, those same conventions are
already injected into your system prompt, so the fetch is a no-op in
that path — but it's the right reflex when someone runs Claude Code
against this repo locally or from another harness.

## Connector permission prompts

This repo ships `.claude/settings.json`, which allows the **read-only**
Homeroom connector calls (`mcp__homeroom__get_*`,
`…__list_*`, `…__whoami`) so they stop prompting one at a time. Everything
that acts — filing a request, opening or advancing a proposal — still asks.
Claude Code applies those rules only after you accept the
workspace trust dialog, which lists them for review. See `.claude/README.md`
for the whole story, including what to do if you are still being prompted
(usually: your connector is registered under a different name than the rules
assume).

## Check that this checkout is current

You may be working in a fork of this app whose `main` is behind the app's
canonical repository, and nothing in the checkout says so: `git fetch origin`
compares the fork with itself. This matters before you **read** code to answer
a question about how the app behaves now, not only before you edit it.

The canonical repository is named in `.claude/homeroom-canonical-repo`. Check against
it, not against `origin`:

```sh
git fetch "$(cat .claude/homeroom-canonical-repo)" main
git merge-base --is-ancestor FETCH_HEAD HEAD && echo current || echo behind
```

`behind` means this checkout does not contain the canonical `main`. To answer
a question, read the canonical code instead (`git show FETCH_HEAD:<path>`,
`git grep <pattern> FETCH_HEAD`). To change code, start from the exact base
commit your Homeroom work order gives, and never merge or rebase onto the
canonical `main` yourself: which commit a change is diffed against decides
what the group votes on. With the Homeroom connector, `get_checkout_status`
answers the same question.

A session-start hook (`.claude/hooks/homeroom-freshness.sh`, see `.claude/README.md`) runs
this check for you and tells you when you are behind. It is silent offline, so
its silence is not proof the checkout is current. Inside Homeroom's dev-chat
the platform fixes the base commit, and none of this applies.

If a rule below this line conflicts with the hosted conventions, the
hosted conventions win. This file is **app-specific** — write down
things about *this* app that belong in the repo: product intent,
data-model quirks, style preferences, opt-in policies (e.g. which
tables you've marked private), etc.

## About Musik Dunia

A mobile-first music maker for every genre, from pop and reggae to regional
and indigenous styles from around the world, helped by AI. The UI is
Indonesian first with an English toggle. (The repo was scaffolded as
"TerraTone"; `dapp.json` now names the app Musik Dunia.)

## App-specific conventions

- The whole frontend lives in one file, `public/index.html`, by request.
- All sound is synthesised with the Web Audio API; never add audio files.
- Styles, scales, tunings, drum voices, instruments and templates are plain
  config objects (`GENRES`, `SCALES`, `TUNINGS`, `DRUMS`, `INSTR`,
  `TEMPLATES`). Add a style by adding one object, not by changing the engine.
- Every traditional style needs: region, instruments, scale/tuning, rhythm,
  example uses, a short cultural note, and must show "Variasi antardaerah
  banyak, periksa dengan pelaku budaya setempat." Avoid uncertain claims and
  stereotypes; say "pendekatan" where a sound is only approximated.
- Projects are stored in the browser (`localStorage`); there are no tables.
- AI lyrics go through `POST /api/lyrics` (platform LLM proxy). Staging has no
  proxy, so the frontend falls back to the template generator.
